We've seen that we can't return elements if they are adjacent to each other
they need to be wrapped in one block such as a div.
We coould also create a component that just spreads the children (like Aux.js) so that
a div would not be needed.
You could also return adjacent elements by returning them via an array:
e.g return [
    <p>I'm a paragraph</p>,
    <p>I'm another paragraph, button or whatnot</p>
]
